 POST ISN'T FINISHED! WILL BE DONE SOON!

Illegal fishing poses a major threat to our marine ecosystems and global seafood supplies. It is reported that as much as 33% of the total fish caught in the world happens through unreported and illegal means. The Nature Conservancy, a charitable environmental organization, is seeking to installing cameras on fisherman's boats to monitor their activities. However, the amount of raw data produced by these cameras is enormous making it cumbersome and expensive to monitor manually. In order to combat this problem, The Nature Conservancy created a competition on Kaggle where they seek help for automating the monitoring process. I found this competition particularly interesting because the work done in this competition can make a true difference in conserving the environment. Therefore, I decided to participate in this competition.

The data provided in the competition included 3777 photos of fisherman catching various types of fish such as Albacore Tuna, sharks, Moonsfish, Dolphinfish, and other species. There are 7 classes of fish and another class where there would be no fish in the picture. My goal is to use machine learning and computer vision to classify which fish species is caught in an image. There are many techniques in computer vision that I could've used to tackle this problem. I decided to use deep learning mainly because all the recent breakthroughs in computer vision have been due to the use of convolutional neural networks.
