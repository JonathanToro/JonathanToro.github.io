Hi, I'm Jonathan Toro. I am a data scientist from NYC. I am currently working as an analyst on the Marketing Science Team at IPG Mediabrands. In addition, I am currently enrolled at Hunter's Master's of Statistics and Applied Mathematics. I previously studied Math at Baruch College and shortly after that attended the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. This blog is to showcase my projects, data science journey, and to share interesting discoveries I have made.
