Hi, I'm Jonathan Toro. I am a data scientist from NYC. I recently graduated from Baruch College majoring in mathematics. My passion for mathematics and problem solving has led me to enrolling in the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. I recently finished this program and am looking for a job as a data scientist. This blog is to showcase my projects, data science journey, and to share interesting discoveries I have made.
